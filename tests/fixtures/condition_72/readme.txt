Description: too much sleep in the last 3 days

Details: average sleep is more than 12 hours

Recommendation: 

1. Put an alarm to wake up in the morning.	

2. Depression is a leading cause of oversleeping because it robs you of your will to get out of bed in the morning. You may feel fatigued and have a hard time waking up. http://www.livestrong.com/article/127972-causes-oversleeping/
	
3. The use of certain substances, namely alcohol and prescription drugs, can make you feel more tired and oversleep, says the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. If you drink, make sure to do so responsibly and not directly before bed. Try alternating one drink with a bottle of water to pace yourself.
